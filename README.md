## INSPIRATION
"Even if just one-fourth of the food currently lost or wasted globally could be saved, it would be enough to feed 870 million hungry people in the world."

Focusing on the environment track, our team decided to address the global issue of food waste. In particular, we focused on how restaurants can find new use for their expiring food. Instead of going to waste, we thought that it would be beneficial to make the food publicly accessible, particularly for low-income students or those living in poverty. This has potential to reduce the costs of food production on the environment and to feed those in need.
