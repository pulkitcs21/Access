## INSPIRATION

"Even if just one-fourth of the food currently lost or wasted globally could be saved, it would be enough to feed 870 million hungry people in the world."
Focusing on the environment track, our team decided to address the global issue of food waste. In particular, we focused on how restaurants can find new use for their expiring food. Instead of going to waste, we thought that it would be beneficial to make the food publicly accessible, particularly for low-income students or those living in poverty. This has potential to reduce the costs of food production on the environment and to feed those in need.

## What it does

Access provides a platform for restaurants to sign in as donors and publicly post what food they have available. Low income   users can use this web app to view postings in their region. Users search by region, and can see the donor, location, a   picture, and description of the food.

## How we built it

We set up our developer environment using XAMPP, which is a popular PHP environment using MariaDB and Apache Web Server. To collaborate, we set up a Github repository and Teletype for Atom. We used Bootstrap and Awesomplete for our user interface and auto complete functions. We used PHP and MySQL to allow us to hold and interact with data.

## What's next for Access

If Access were to take off, we would like to see distribution points in areas with high amounts of food waste, for example, areas with a high density of restaurants. Creating a system of trust is also essential to the growth for Access. We would look to create a verification system to make sure both donors and users were trustable.
